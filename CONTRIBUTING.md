Contributing
============

First, please do contribute!

There are three ways to contribute:

1. introduce spm to your friends
2. write a spm plugin
3. send pull request to spm


Checklist
---------

* On first cloning the repo, run `make` from your command line to ensure all dependencies are met
* Make your changes in a separate branch than `master`. It'll be easier for you to manage.
* Write unit tests!
* Run unit tests! There's a shortcut from your command line: `make test`.
* Run lint! `make lint`
* Send a pull request and explain your changes and why they are necessary.

No contributions will be accepted that do not pass all tests or throw any linter errors.

The spm codebase is highly tested and linted, as a way to guarantee functionality and keep all code written in a particular style for readability.
