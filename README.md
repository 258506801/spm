# Static Package Manager

---------------------------

This is a total rewrite of spm, it is still on heavy development.
You should use the old [spm](https://github.com/spmjs/spm) right now.

## Release

We have a regular release schedule:

1. monthly release for big features or API changes
2. weekly(maybe longer) release for small features and bug fix
3. daily(maybe days) release in canary channel

### Stable Channel
